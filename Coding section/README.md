## Technical Questions

Difference between class and object with example?

you have 5 bugs. how will you prioritize?

### * Class Design *
Design an allergy class with name, symptoms and severity of patient and how would you add it to a patient class. Asked about debugging skills and parameter checking. Track history of patient with allergies. Validate any one field of allergy class.
Design a medication class dealing with dosages, quantity, duration, start, end date, so on and so forth. Add frequency based on prescription Handle situations with dealing with duration or as needed meds. Technical questions on possibly bugs and how would you handle . How would you design an object to keep track of a patient's medicine schedule? 

Design a Medication Notification class where the nurse is notified to give patient a medicine based on his dosage schedule, 4 times a day for a week etc. Also design a method in which if the patient had to take a medicine only when needed

Design a temperature class dealing with temperature, and how do distinguish when someone has a fever or their temperature is higher than normal. How would you design an object to send an alert if a patient has a fever, given temperature readings every few minutes? Design a Temp Class which takes input as C, F or K and also consider the part of body from which temp is measured. Give a result through a method whether the patient has fever or not. Track patients fever in every one hour and create a report based on the analysis.  Construct a class for Person Demographics. What kind of data types you use?  Was asked to design a Temperature class for recording Temp for every hour (Used a circular queue which the interviewer liked )
a question about log case situation having thread id and process id( glass door has the question posted can refer it if needed) , Was asked to write a scheduler method for the told class , it was a difficult question as they are expecting us to know the calender and date class 

Find the distance between two points.  

Write the logic for coding a calculator  

Write the logic for coding a scheduler

How do you reverse a sentence?  

Check if string is palindrome.  

Given five numbers between 1-52 check whether you can generate 42 by using operations addition, multiplication and subtraction. Bruteforce approach? Write a program to give the number of ways to get the result 32 by performing+, - , * , / on a array of numbers. Given numbers 1 through 52, take 5 unique numbers and determine if the number 42 can be made using any combination of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) on those 5 numbers.

Name as many ways as you can think of to transfer a file from one computer to another.  
 
Describe a time you had trouble getting along with a manager or professor. How did you manage the difficult relationship, and what was the end result?  Tell us about a time where you had a problem with a co-worker, and what you did you resolve that problem.  

Describe a time you were involved in a project where the requirements kept changing but the deadline was not extended. How did you handle the situation, and what was the end result? 

Every letter is associated with a number as a-1, b-2 , .... So if the string is abcd it should give the output as 0123, if the string is with any special characters the output has to be "none". Input: abcdefgh Output: 01234567 If the input is anything other than small letters(alphabets), the output should be none 

There are arrays in a JSON file and we have to print the sum of selected words.

Couple of Data Structures questions and which one better based on given scenarios. Also, covered Algorithms and efficiency based on the solution. Try to use Map and get solution in O(1) 

Given one sentence at a time, return the second last word of the sentence.  1 

Given a number, reverse its digits and add to the original number. Now check whether the number formed by performing the above mentioned operations is a Palindrome or not. If not, repeat the above process again. Return the number of steps required to reach a Palindromic number. 

Given one sentence at a time, reverse all words in the sentence.  

Given an array of n (between 10 to 20) integers 1 through 9, return the index of the lowest unique integer (i.e. [1, 8, 2, 5, 2, 1, 6, 9, 7, 8] -> returns index 3 from value 5)

Given a string with a mix of comma separated words and numbers, print out two strings which contain only words in one and numbers in the other separated by commas.

Given two lists as input ex. 1,2,3,4;5,6,7. Print the last integer of first list and first integer of second list. If they are same only print one, if not print in ascending order ex. 5,4. Pretty simple only took about 10 min.  

Given a string separated by a space like "123456 abc+efg" determine the solution by mapping integers to letters like a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4, e:5, f:6. The only operations allowed were + or -. So the calculated solution that made the tests pass was 123+456 = 579. Again took about 10 min of the 15min allowed.  

Implement a stack with a push method and alternating pop method. This one was the 30min problem but only took around 20 min.  

write a program that will decipher code that contains letters and symbols., if letter return the appropriate numeric value otherwise output invalid code  

What is an enumeration?  

How many subsets of a given array sum to zero?  

Convert binary to decimal (30 minutes)

Print true if a given number is armstrong number, otherwise print false (15 minutes)

Substring repetition. Example: Given string abcabcabc, output 3
